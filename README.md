![TSSG](https://github.com/mikec964/chelmbigstock/blob/master/TSSGwiki.png) This repository, **tssg-data-analytics** supports the **Data Analytics** subgroup of the Chelmsford, MA [Technical Skills Share Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TSSG-Chelmsford/info) (TSSG). We're a group of professionals in the Chelmsford area learning Data Science. We meet weekly and work through various hands-on learning projects. Extensive notes on our past activites are on GitHub. See the [ChelmBigStock TSSG wiki] (https://github.com/mikec964/chelmbigstock/wiki).

This repository contains information on data science project activites done utilizing the [Kaggle Competions] (https://www.kaggle.com)

As a group, we have studied the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer] training competion.
Code for this competion can be run using Kaggle Scripts which supports the direct execution of R, Python and other languages. Note that Kaggle recommends new users start by working through the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) learning activity which many of us have also reviewed.

We have reviewed the benchmark example utilizing Random Forests. A random forest classifier is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. Packages are available in many languages, R and Python for example. It can be sucessfully used by those with out statistical expertice.

Some of us are learning the R-language and have installed R and RStudio on our laptops.  Others have been learning Python and have installed Python and iPython Notebook/Jupyter from the [Anaconda distribution.] (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Note that iPython support has transitioned to [Jupyter,] (https://jupyter.org) a platform that will support mulitple languages, Python, R, Julia and more.
