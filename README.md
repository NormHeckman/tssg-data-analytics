![TSSG](https://github.com/mikec964/chelmbigstock/blob/master/TSSGwiki.png) This repository, **tssg-data-analytics** supports the **Data Analytics** subgroup of the Chelmsford, MA [Technical Skills Share Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TSSG-Chelmsford/info) (TSSG). We're a group of professionals in the Chelmsford area learning Big Data and Hadoop. We meet weekly and work through various hands-on projects. Extensive project notes are located in the GitHub  ChelmBigStock TSSG wiki [here] (https://github.com/mikec964/chelmbigstock/wiki).

This repository contains information regarding our project activites done using the [Kaggle Competions] (https://www.kaggle.com)

As a group, we have studied the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer] training competion. 
Code for this competion can be run using Kaggle Scripts which supports the direct execution of R, Python and other languages.
Kaggle recommends new users start by working with the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) learning activity which many of us have also reviewed.

Some of us have installed R and RStudio or Python from the Anaconda [distribution] (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) and [iPython] / [Jupyter] (https://jupyter.org) on their computers.
