![TSSG](https://github.com/mikec964/chelmbigstock/blob/master/TSSGwiki.png) This repository, **tssg-data-analytics** supports the **Data Analytics** subgroup of the Chelmsford, MA [Technical Skills Share Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TSSG-Chelmsford/info) (TSSG). We meet every Wednesday in Acton or Chelmsford (3rd Wends of month) for a general/status meeting. We also have a working meeting every Friday in Acton. We're a group of professionals in the Chelmsford / Acton area learning Data Science. We work through various hands-on learning projects and seek to work on a longer term project to demonstrate our skills. Extensive notes on our groups past activites are in another GitHub repository. See the [ChelmBigStock TSSG wiki] (https://github.com/mikec964/chelmbigstock/wiki).

This repository contains information on data science project activites done within the [Kaggle Competions] (https://www.kaggle.com) as well as independant projects related to our learnings.

As a group, we have studied the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) training competion.
Code for this competion can be run using Kaggle Scripts which support the execution of R, Python and other language code directly on the Kaggle website. Kaggle recommends new users start by working through the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) learning activity Many of us have also worked on that knowledge competition.

We have reviewed the benchmark example utilizing Random Forests. A random forest classifier is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. Packages are available in many languages, R and Python for example. RandomForests can be sucessfully used by those with little statistical expertice.

Some of us are learning the R-language and have installed R and RStudio on our laptops.  Others have been learning Python and have installed Python and iPython Notebook/Jupyter from the [Anaconda distribution.] (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Note that iPython support has transitioned to [Jupyter,] (https://jupyter.org) a platform that will support mulitple languages, Python, R, Julia and more.

We've looked briefly at the [Census Data Exploration]
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/2013-american-community-survey) open-ended knowledge challenge which includes mapping tools. We are are currently investigating the [San Francisco Crime Classification] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime) knowledge challenge which asks specific questions, and provides an opportunity for exploring mapping. We are building an understanding of other participants scripts for analyzing the data and predicting the answers.

We have looked at some other worked examples from Kaggle. A summary will be added here real soon now.

We currently seek to work together on a longer term project to analize social media data. Lots of examples of appoaches, methods, and code snipits is avalable on Kaggl.com and the  web. Twitter data is a good candidate. We have used cree.py, and Open Source Intelligence Automation tool (OSINT) which only gathers Tweets which have geocodes attached.  We are looking some other open source tools to collect tweets. There are also 12 databases of Twitter data currently available on Kaggle. Some code has been adapted from a Kaggle contributor and can be run locally on a pc under Jupyter/iPython which can read Twitter files collected by cree.py.  The intention is to build a collection of tools that can collect tweets, analyze, cross-corelate with other data sources.  We will leave behind documentation and code demonstrating our skills.  Thereby providing benefit to the entire project team who understands and has contributed.
